"""
Mosaico SDK - Python client for the Mosaico Data Platform.

This module provides the main entry points for interacting with Mosaico:

- **MosaicoClient**: The primary client for connecting to the platform.
- **Handlers**: Classes for reading/writing sequences and topics.
- **Models**: Data structures for the Mosaico ontology (sensors, geometry, etc.).

Example:
    >>> from mosaicolabs import MosaicoClient
    >>> with MosaicoClient.connect("localhost", 6726) as client:
    ...     handler = client.sequence_handler("my_sequence")
