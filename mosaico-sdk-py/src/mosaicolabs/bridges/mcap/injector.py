"""
MCAP Injection Tool.

This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) and a Python API for injecting
data from MCAP files into the Mosaico data platform.

It handles the complex orchestration of:
1.  **Ingestion:** Reading raw messages from MCAP files using `MCAPLoader`.
2.  **Adaptation:** converting MCAP-specific types (e.g., `sensor_msgs.Image`) into
    Mosaico Ontology types (e.g., `Image`) via `MCAPAdapterBase` subclasses.
3.  **Transmission:** streaming the converted data to the Mosaico server using
    `MosaicoClient` with efficient batching and parallelism.

Typical usage as a script:
    $ mosaicolabs.mcap_injector ./data.mcap --name "Test_Run_01"

Typical usage as a library:
    config = MCAPInjectionConfig(file_path=Path("data.mcap"), ...)
    injector = MCAPInjector(config)
    injector.run()

@dataclass
class MCAPInjectionConfig:
    """
    The central configuration object for the MCAP injection process.

    This data class serves as the single source of truth for all injection settings,
    decoupling the orchestration logic from CLI arguments or configuration files.
    It encapsulates network parameters, file paths, and advanced filtering logic required
    to drive a successful ingestion session.

    Attributes:
        file_path (Path): Absolute or relative path to the input MCAP file.
        sequence_name (str): The name for the new sequence to be created on the Mosaico server.
        metadata (dict): User-defined metadata to attach to the sequence (e.g., driver, weather, location).
        topic_metadata (Optional[Dict[str, dict]]): Mapping of exact topic name to metadata to
            merge into the metadata computed from the message schema and the source MCAP file.
        update_if_exists (bool): If `True`, append this MCAP's topics to an existing sequence with
            the same name instead of raising an error. Default: False.
        host (str): Hostname or IP of the Mosaico server. Defaults to "localhost".
        port (int): Port of the Mosaico server. Defaults to 6726.
        on_error (SessionLevelErrorPolicy): Behavior when an ingestion error occurs (Delete the partial sequence or Report the error).
            Default: [`SessionLevelErrorPolicy.Report`][mosaicolabs.enum.SessionLevelErrorPolicy.Report]
        topics_on_error (Union[TopicLevelErrorPolicy, Dict[str, TopicLevelErrorPolicy]]): Behavior when a topic write fails.
            Default: [`TopicLevelErrorPolicy.Raise`][mosaicolabs.enum.TopicLevelErrorPolicy.Raise]
            Set to a [`TopicLevelErrorPolicy`][mosaicolabs.enum.TopicLevelErrorPolicy] to apply the same policy to all topics.
            Set to a `Dict[str, TopicLevelErrorPolicy]` to apply different policies to different (subset of) topics.
        channels (Optional[List[str]]): List of channel patterns used to filter available channels.
            Supports shell-style glob patterns (e.g., ["/cam/\\*", "\\*camera_info"]).
            Patterns starting with "!" are treated as exclusions (e.g., ["\\!/cam/debug\\*"]).
            Patterns are evaluated in ORDER (gitignore-like semantics). If None, all available channels are loaded.
        serialization_formats (Optional[Dict[str, SerializationFormat]]): Mapping of MCAP schema names
            (e.g. "sensor_msgs.PointCloud2") to the `SerializationFormat` used when synthesizing an
            `Unmodeled` ontology for channels that have no registered Mosaico adapter. Message types not
            present in this mapping default to `SerializationFormat.Default`.
            Default: None
        log_level (str): Logging verbosity level ("DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR").
        mosaico_api_key (Optional[str]): The API key for authentication on the mosaico server.
            If provided it must have the `write` permission.
            Default: None
        tls_cert_path (Optional[str]): Path to the TLS certificate file for secure connection on the mosaico server.
            Default: None
        enable_tls (bool): Enable the TLS communication protocol. Defaults to False.
        dry_run (bool): If `True`, resolves and reports which topics would be ingested without
            connecting to the Mosaico server or writing any data. Default: False.

    Controls what happens when a sequence named `sequence_name` already exists on the server.

    If `True`, the injector appends this mcap's topics to the existing sequence instead of
    creating a new one. Use this both when a MCAP recording is split across multiple MCAP files
    that should all land in the same sequence, and when re-ingesting a derived/reprocessed MCAP
    (e.g. offline estimation results) whose topics should be merged into a sequence that was
    already ingested from the original recording.

    If `False` (default), the injector creates a new sequence and raises an error if a sequence
    with the same name already exists.

    Each topic's metadata records the source MCAP file it was ingested from (see
    `schema_metadata` handling in `_process_message`), so which MCAP file contributed which
    topics remains traceable even after multiple updates to the same sequence.

    Caveat: existence is checked and then acted upon in two separate steps (not atomically),
    so running concurrent injections against the same `sequence_name` can race. Avoid
    concurrent ingestion into the same sequence name.

    Caveat: resuming after a crash is NOT idempotent. `session_writer.get_topic_writer()`
    (see `_process_message`) only consults an in-memory cache scoped to the current process's
    session (`_BaseSessionWriter._topic_writers`); it has no knowledge of topics created by a
    previous, crashed run. So re-running the same MCAP with `update_if_exists=True` after a
    crash will call `topic_create` again for topics that were already fully ingested before
    the crash, which the server is expected to reject as duplicates (behavior not covered by
    SDK-level tests as of this writing). There is currently no dedup against the topics already
    present in the target sequence (available server-side via `MosaicoClient.sequence_handler(
    sequence_name).topics`, the same mechanism `MosaicoLoader` already uses) before calling
    `topic_create`. A safe resume would need to check that list first and skip topics already
    present, rather than only checking the local per-process cache.

# --- Main Injector Class ---


class MCAPInjector:
    """
    Main controller for the MCAP ingestion workflow.

    The `MCAPInjector` orchestrates the entire data pipeline from the physical storage
    to the remote Mosaico server. It manages resource lifecycles, establishes network
    connections, and drives the main adaptation loop.

    **Core Workflow Architecture:**

    1.  **Resource Management**: Opens the `MCAPLoader` for file access and the `MosaicoClient` for networking.
    2.  **Stream Negotiation**: Creates a `SequenceWriter` on the server and opens individual `TopicWriter` streams.
    3.  **Adaptation Loop**: Iterates through MCAPMessage, translates them via the `MCAPBridge`, and pushes them to the server.

    Example:
        ```python
        from mosaicolabs.bridges.mcap import MCAPInjector, MCAPInjectionConfig

        # Define configuration

        _malformed_message_counts (Dict[str, int]): Per-topic count of messages skipped due to
            a deserialization error or empty payload (see `_process_message`), used to render
            the "Malformed Messages (Skipped)" summary table at the end of the run.
